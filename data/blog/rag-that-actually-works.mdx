## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) promised accuracy through grounding — yet most real deployments underperform.  
The culprit is rarely the model. It’s almost always **retrieval**.

This post outlines the practical design patterns that separate a prototype from a production-grade RAG system.

## The Anatomy of a Working RAG Stack

### 1. Smart Chunking

Chunking is not just splitting text.  
Combine **semantic windows** (context-aware embeddings) with **structural cues** like headings and lists.  
This balance preserves topic coherence without overwhelming the model’s context window.

### 2. Hybrid Search

Hybrid retrieval blends **dense vector search** (semantic) and **sparse search** (BM25).  
Dense handles paraphrase; BM25 handles precision and uncommon terms.  
Together, they create a safety net for long-tail queries.

### 3. Reranking and Query Rewriting

- **Rerank** top-K candidates using a cross-encoder to reorder by true relevance.
- **Rewrite queries** with synonym expansion, acronym resolution, and context normalisation.

### 4. Token Budget Discipline

Good retrieval minimises waste.  
De-duplicate near-identical chunks and limit context to the **Pareto knee** — the point where accuracy gains flatten while cost rises steeply.

## Evaluating What Matters

Judge RAG not only by whether it answers correctly, but **why**.  
Track two metrics in tandem:

- **Document Recall** — the retriever’s coverage.
- **Faithfulness** — the generator’s adherence to sources.

A system that scores high on both is not just accurate — it’s **trustworthy**.

## Reflection

In 2025, RAG is no longer novel — it’s infrastructure.  
The difference lies in how thoughtfully we design it.

True progress in retrieval isn’t about complexity.  
It’s about **clarity of intent** — every component serving the simple goal: _ground truth that stays grounded._
