## Introduction

Machine learning systems are now core infrastructure yet many are built like experiments.  
Without discipline in CI/CD, _the same codebase can yield different models_, and provenance often disappears in the rush to ship.

Hardening ML pipelines isn’t bureaucracy. It’s engineering hygiene — a quiet foundation for trust.

## Build Once, Trust Always

### 1. Lock the Environment

Use `pip-tools` or `conda-lock` to freeze dependencies.  
Avoid “latest” tags — reproducibility starts with determinism.

### 2. Pin the Data

Treat datasets like code.  
Store them in object storage with content hashes; version every change.

### 3. Generate SBOMs

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) lists every dependency used.  
Tools like **Syft** automate this and ensure license and vulnerability compliance.

### 4. Sign Everything

Use **Cosign** or similar tools to sign artifacts, notebooks, and models.  
SLSA-style attestations verify where and how each model was built.

### 5. Principle of Least Privilege

Short-lived OIDC tokens in CI replace static secrets.  
Rotate aggressively and audit usage.

## Reflection

Security and velocity are not opposites. They compound.  
Teams that codify trust early ship faster — and sleep better.

In a world where every model can influence decisions, reproducibility and provenance are no longer optional.  
They are how **machine learning earns its reliability badge**.
