“Innovation is not about one big idea; it’s about a thousand small breakthroughs.”  
— Jensen Huang

I’m **Asmita Sonavane**, an engineer and researcher exploring how **AI and software systems** can shape the next generation of intelligent technology.

Currently pursuing my **Masters at New York University**, I focus on building systems where machine learning, data, and software design converge which calable, explainable, and built with intention.

My work bridges **AI development, data analytics, and backend engineering**, transforming ideas into systems that perform in the real world. This is just the beginning of a journey where I share experiments, insights, and reflections. My hope is that these stories spark curiosity, offer clarity, and remind us that **great technology starts with asking the right questions**.

If you’re someone who loves to build, explore, and think deeply.....

**Welcome, you’ll feel right at home here:))**
